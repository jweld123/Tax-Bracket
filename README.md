# Tax-Bracket
Project to calculate Canadian taxes in 2025.

The GUI gives an approximate estimation of taxes owed to the federal and provincial governments based on the data obtained at the following link: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html#toc0

It also allows the user to input their estimated income based on the taxes they payed.

Finally, it suggests to the user a RRSP contribution in order to bring their taxable income to the exact number to pay the taxes they ended up paying. (Difference between their income and the expected income based on the taxes they payed)
